Before we plan to start anything with Docker, we need a laptop/PC level setting.
This setting is called "Virtualization", and we need to "Enable" it.

This is done from BIOS. We need to check every option of BIOS (Different laptops/different navigations). 
Once we enable Virtualization, we will need to restart our computer, to bring the changes into effectivness.
